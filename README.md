# Dungeon Crawler Group 43

## Project Purpose
This project was meant to introduce groups to utilizing advanced object oriented design patterns as well as working in an agile environment.

## Personal Involvement
This was a group project, and I don't claim to be responsible for all the code here.  My contributions were mainly in the "model" section, where I fleshed out the backend logic of the game. This involves implementing logic for a maze of rooms, a player, various monsters, weapons, and potions.
